<h1>Food Delivary System</h1>

The objective of my project is to ctreate an interface from which the user can search fir the restaurent and ordered for the food

<h2>Key Stack</h2>
The Keystack I have applied here was HTML,Bootstrap,JavaScript

<h2>BackEnd</h2>
I have Used my local Storage for creating my API.

Syntax Used:
localStorage.getItem
localStorage.setItem
localStorage.removeItem

From the Local Storage i have applied JSON to parse the input from the localstorage and Stringify the data to store the content to the local storage

<h2>Admin Panel</h2>
From the admin panel i have add the restaurent and menu items to the user Interface.From there the user can able to search the restaurent and irder for the food items.

<h2>User Panel</h2>
From the User Interface the user can able to search for the restaurent and order the items the bill will be generated in the dashboard.Once they click check out the ordered item will get erased and order will be processes to the customer.
